# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This project, contains the implementation of KNN (with arbitrary K) and Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch.
Also, it contains the implementation of SVM, KNN, and Multinomial Naive Bayes using WEKA 3 for comparison purposes.
You can access the UI in Main.java.

Besides training and applying these algorithms, you can use the Evaluator in order to evaluate the system. Provided evaluation methods are accuracy, precision, recall, macro-averaged Fmeaure, and AUC.

All provided algorithms and evaluation methods can be used for two or more classses.
